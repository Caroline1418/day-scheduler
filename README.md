# day-scheduler

This work day scheduler is great for busy working people. It will show you the date and the hour of the day with the task that needs to be completed at that time. Past times will appear gray, present time will appear red and the future will show green. As a working professional with a very busy schedule, I can definitely say that this would be very helpful.
